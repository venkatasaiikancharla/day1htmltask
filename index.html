<h1>FULL STACK APLICATIONS<h1>


<p>A full stack application is a software solution that includes both the front-end and back-end components of a website. Full stack developers can build, manage, and deploy the entire application, from the user interface to database management.<P>

<h1>HTML<h1>

<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It tells the web browser how to display text, links, images, and other forms of multimedia on a webpage. HTML sets up the basic structure of a website, and then CSS and JavaScript add style and interactivity to make it look and function better.<p>

<h1>JAVA SCRIPT<h1>

<P>JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic content for websites. It is a lightweight, cross-platform, and single-threaded programming language. JavaScript is an interpreted language that executes code line by line providing more flexibility.

HTML adds Structure to a web page, CSS styles it and JavaScript brings it to life by allowing users to interact with elements on the page, such as actions on clicking buttons, filling out forms, and showing animations.
JavaScript on the client side is directly executed in the user's browser. Almost all browsers have JavaScript Interpreter and do not need to install any software. There is also a browser console where you can test your JavaScript code.
JavaScript is also used on the Server side (on Web Servers) to do operations like accessing databases, file handling and security features to send responses, to browsers.
Hello World Program.<p>



<h1>TYPE SCRIPT<h1>
<P>TypeScript is a powerful, open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions, making it a superset of JavaScript. TypeScript enhances the development experience by enabling developers to catch errors early through type checking, and it facilitates the development of large-scale applications with improved code quality and maintainability.

In this TypeScript Tutorial, we'll learn all the basic to advanced concepts of TypeScript such as Utility, methods, functions, etc.<P>

<h1>REACT JS<h1>

<P>React is a JavaScript Library known for front-end development (or user interface). It is popular due to its component-based architecture, Single Page Applications (SPAs) and Virtual DOM for building web applications that are fast, efficient, and scalable.

Applications are built using reusable components that enable the reload of only the changed part of the UI. Hence we get a better user experience with React.
Allows you to describe how the UI should look based on the state of your application.
Uses a virtual DOM to optimize updates, making applications faster and more efficient.
Enforces a one-way data flow, making the application predictable and easier to debug.
It uses JSX which combines HTML-like syntax with JavaScript's functionality, making it easy to shift to React from JavaScript.<P>


<h1>EXPRESS JS <h1>
<p>Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a list of features for building web and mobile applications easily. It simplifies the development of server-side applications by offering an easy-to-use API for routing, middleware, and HTTP utilities.

Built on Node.js for fast and scalable server-side development.
Simplifies routing and middleware handling for web applications.
Supports building REST APIs, real-time applications, and single-page applications.
Provides a lightweight structure for flexible and efficient server-side development.<P>

<h1>NODE JS<h1>

<P>Node.js is a powerful, open-source, and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine.

It allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser, making it ideal for building scalable server-side and networking applications.
JavaScript was earlier mainly used for frontend development. With Node JS (Introduced in 2009), JavaScript became a backend language as well.
Non-blocking, event-driven architecture for high performance.
Supports the creation of REST APIs, real-time applications, and microservices.
Comes with a rich library of modules through npm (Node Package Manager).<P>

<h1>MONGO DB<h1>

<p>In today’s data-driven world, the ability to efficiently store and manage large amounts of data is crucial. MongoDB, a powerful NoSQL database, has become a go-to choice for developers looking for flexibility, scalability, and performance. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, making it easier to handle complex data structures and scale out horizontally.

In this tutorial, we’ll guide you through the basics of MongoDB, from setting up your environment to performing CRUD operations and optimizing performance. Whether you’re new to databases or looking to expand your skills, this step by step guide to MongoDB will help you harness the full potential of MongoDB. Let’s get started and explore how MongoDB can revolutionize the way you handle data. But before this let’s have a quick look in MongoDB.<p>

<h1>BOOTSTRAP<h1>

<p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source collection of CSS and JavaScript/jQuery code used for creating dynamic websites layout and web applications. Bootstrap is one of the most popular front-end frameworks which has really a nice set of predefined CSS codes. Bootstrap uses different types of classes to make responsive websites. Bootstrap 5 was officially released on 16 June 2020 after several months of redefining its features.

Bootstrap is a framework that is suitable for mobile-friendly web development. it means the code and the template available on bootstrap are applicable to various screen sizes. It is responsive for every screen size. The framework is free and can be used in 2 ways that are either by downloading the zip files and including libraries/modules of bootstrap in the project or directly including the URL of bootstrap and using the online version.<P>
